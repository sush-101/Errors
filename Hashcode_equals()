1. Hashcode is used for hash based collections like sets,maps.
2. As hash-based collections work on hashing, when an object is to be placed in hash-based collections, hashcode function is called to
   get the hash of the object. So based on this integer, the object is placed at the 'hash' memory location.
   
*** For standard classes like list,Strings hashcode is written in such a way that for the same content same hashcode is generated.
*** But for custom classes, this is not the case. We need to override the hashcode function for same('same' is defined according to us) objects is same.

3. Everthing is fine till now, but the hashcode function can sometimes provide same hash for two different objects('different' is defined according to us).
   Here comes the concept of bucket.
4. In the bucket, the objects which generate same hash are placed(the objects can be equal or unequal to each other) through links.

What happens when you perform contains() method ?

1. The hashcode is generated for the object you want to search.
2. The bucket number you get is to be searched. But the bucket can contain unequal objects (because hashcode can generate same hash for different objects of different classes
    as well).
3. Here comes the concept of equals().
4 equals() is used to compare objects within bucket. The equals method for default classes like String,Lists is predefined.
5. For customized objects we have to write the equals() method according to our requirements.

SUMMARY : Same objects are placed in the same bucket(overriden). But different objects can also generate same hashcode and they might end up in the same bucket.
So, equals() method is invoked within the bucket before overriding.
Colliding hashcodes and then searching within the bucket using equals can increase the Time complexity , so writing hashcode function that does not make collisions
is recommended and it also does not require equals method. But that is not always possible , possible when the data size is less.

//CODE
class Pair{
    int key,value;
    Pair(int x,int y){
        key = x;value = y;
    }
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj){
        if(this == obj)return true;
        if(obj == null || obj.getClass() != this.getClass())return false;
        Pair temp = (Pair)obj; 
        if(this.key == temp.key && this.value == temp.value)return true;
        return false;
    }
    @Override
    public int hashCode(){
        return key*7+value*11;
    }
}
TIP : The above code is more useful while dealing with maps because maps need hashcode to place the object or replace.
But in the above example as we are dealing with sets to only check the presence the code can be modified as below :
 PAIR CLASS can be removed.
                int hashcode1 = x1*7+y2*11,hashcode2 = x2*7+y1*11;
                if(set.contains(hashcode1) && set.contains(hashcode2)){
                   //code
                }
